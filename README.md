PLEASE NOTE:

This software is no longer developed.  This repository is here for 
archival/historical purposes only.  It would require quite a bit 
of work to port to a modern GNOME 3 environment.

The GFAX project aims to provide a free front end to the various 
facsimile programs available for Linux and other operating systems 
that use GNOME.

GFAX provides the familiar "pop up" window and phone book support 
when one "prints" to a "fax" printer.
