  1). (Q) I get the following error after I install gfax:
      	    Unhandled Exception: GConf.NoSuchKeyException: Key
      (A) Loging out and login back in should fix this.  The GConfd
          process is not picking up the new keys.  
  
  2) (Q) How do I add Hylafax users and passwords on the fax server?
     (A) Login to your server as "root" and addusers with the following
         command:  
		     faxadduser -a <secret password> -p <secret password> username
         The -a and -p otions are passwords that you choose, -a must be given
		 for administrative rights to your jobs.  Admin rights allow you to
		 remove jobs from the server.
		 
  3) (Q) How do I send an entire phone book?
     (A) When sending the facsimile choose the phonebook name and click "OK"
	     this will select every number in the selected phonebook.  You may
		 de-select individual entries by un-checking them.
  
  4) (Q) How do I get cover pages working?
     (A) Coverpage support is not yet included.  Most people just add the 
	     cover page from their word processor.
