Build Ubuntu package with 
 dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

My CVS notes

CHECKOUT
--------
Check out the current working branch and prune directories
	cvs co -P gfax
This would assume you have changed from the HEAD branch.
To checkout a named tag
	cvs co -P -r gfax_0_7_2 gfax

While branch names refer to the latest code at the end of a 
branch (and as such, are dynamic), tag names refer 
to the static version of code that existed upon the tag's creation. 
As a result, you cannot commit changes back into the tree at the 
tagged place that you checked them out from.


NEW RELEASE
-----------
To create a new branch:
Branch name is gfax_0_7, the <tag> tag works on the working
copy so you should do a HEAD checkout first.
	cvs co -P gfax
	cvs tag -r gfax_0_7 
Use this when releaseing a new version of the program
Access the branch with:
	cvs co -P -r gfax_0_7

To find out what branch a file is on do this:
	cvs status -v filename


ADD FILE
--------
To add a file to the repository, create the file locally and then add it:
	cvs add filename
	cvs commit

MERGE release back to HEAD
--------------------------
Checkout HEAD first
	cvs co -P -r HEAD
now merge tag (maybe from branch)
	cvs update -j gfax_0_7
then commit
	cvs commit
You can only do this once per branch, after that you must merge the branch
and file version:
	cvs update -j 1.2.2.2 -j gfax_0_7 src/gui.cs


Move to branch
	cvs update -r gfax_0_7
Move back to HEAD
	cvs update -A
