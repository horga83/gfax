The GFAX project aims to provide a free front end to the various 
facsimile programs available for Linux and other operating systems 
that use GNOME.

GFAX provides the familiar "pop up" window and phone book support 
when one "prints" to a "fax" printer. 

This version has the following features: 

      - Works with Hylafax and Efax
	  - View status of Hylafax server, send, done and receive queues.
	  - Delete jobs in send queues.
	  - Modify jobs in send queue.  Number, time to send etc.
	  - Download, view, print and delete received faxes on the Hylafax server.
	  - Delayed sending of Hylafax jobs, up to 30 days in the future.
	  - Both IP and username/password authentication for Hylafax.
	  - Cancel partially sent jobs, (while sending file to Hylafax server).
	  - Retrieves and displays total number of jobs in queue.
	  - Number of jobs in send queue displays in icon in task bar.  
	  - Auto timed refresh of server and queue status can be toggled on or off.
	  - Complete list of jobs in queues with status and time to send.
	  
	- Phonebooks
	  - Define Gfax phone books.
	  - Use your Evolution Adressbooks - See Note 1.
	  - Add and delete entries to Gfax phone books.
	  - Send fax to entire phonebook easily.
	  - Convenient wizard for adding new phonebooks.
	  - Deselect individual numbers form outgoing list.
	  
	- Can fax postscript documents from the command line as well via 
	  Gnome print, OpenOffice and most other X applications.
	- Faxing of postscript files straight from Gfax.
	

NOTES:
  1)  Evolution addressbooks are read only at the moment and only displays
      entries that have a number in the "Business Fax" field.
	  
	  
BUILDING FROM THE TAR BALL
