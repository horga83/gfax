Whats new in gfax-0.7.7
============================================
Gfax should now work with all software that can print to a CUPS printer.

Gfax is now under the GPLv3 license.


Whats new in gfax-0.7.6

of work has been done to polish this release.  Many thanks to the crew

Much work has been put into polishing Hylafax and Efax support.
The following is a list of new or changed items.  If you have tried Gfax in 
the past and have been disappointed we recommend you checkout the 0.7.6 version.
We think you will be pleased.  There is still work to be done but we 
have a great group of people providing feedback, which really helps.
  

EFAX CHANGES:
=============
 -When sending a fax with Efax, the main status window will display the 
  progress and the progressbar will pulse while the fax is being transmitted.
 -The appbar will display the "Sending fax..." state.
 -There is no longer a gfax.proc file, the GUI is updated directly from the 
  efaxd thread.
 -The queue scanning is now 30 seconds instead of 60 seconds for dealing with
  faxes sent via Efax.

HYLAFAX CHANGES:
================
 -Much of the network traffic is now asynchronous, which means Gfax will 
  not hang when getting status, switching tabs etc.  More to follow in the
  next version.
 -Main progressbar now pulses when there is network traffic.
 -Server status is now updated whenever the queue status is updated.
 -Can now double click on a received facsimile to to view it.
 -Can now select multiple or all received faxes and delete them.
 -Double clicking on job to send will now popup job modify dialog in send tab.
 -Gfax will check for permission to read fax from the fax server and popup a
  notification if the user does not have permission to view the fax.

OTHER CHANGES:
==============
 -Debian control file has been updated with proper dependancies.
 -Removed depreciated Gnome.About and replaced with Gtk.AboutDialog.

BUGS FIXED:
===========
 -Fix: "Add" button was not enabled if adding just numbers to the phonebook.
 -Fix: When sending a fax via Efax, if the fax result was "Busy" Gfax would 
       not retry.  Gfax will now try the set number of times (EfaxRetry).
 -Fix: "Don't try to open a non existing phonebook file.
 -Fix: Various callback event args have been changed for newer versions of
       Gtk-Sharp, these have been updated.

Bug fix release. Toggle in list of items to send was not active.

Whats new in gfax-0.6.3
============================================
Bug fix release. Stupid typo on my part stopped phonebook working 
properly.

Whats new in gfax-0.6.2
============================================
Bug fix release. When sending a fax and selecting a number from the 
phone book, the number and organization entry were swapped.

Whats new in gfax-0.6.1
============================================
Changes have been made to allow Gfax to compile against mono-beta3 (0.96)
and Gtk#-0.98 or higher, will probably not work with any earlier versions.
This is in preparation for the up coming Mono 1.0 release.


Whats new in gfax-0.6.0, Major point release
============================================
Changes have been made to allow Gfax to compile against Gtk#-0.17, 
and will probably not work with any earlier versions.

Full username and password authentication is now working in Hylafax.
Authentication can now be either by allowing the machine host name or
IP address or system administrators can add Hylafax users and passwords
for their fax server (see FAQ).

Gfax now runs the main application after sending a fax with the send 
wizard, enabling immediate status of the fax job to be viewed.

Gfax now fully supports delayed sending of facsimiles with from the
send wizard and the main application.  Facsimiles can be delayed up to 
30 days in the future.

Status queue displays have been updated to display the "Send At" time 
for all jobs.

While transferring jobs to the hylafax server the user can press the 
"Cancel" button, deleting the job/file on the fax server and returning
to the main display.

Gfax-0.6 is now in updated on the GNOME CVS repository.


Whats new in gfax-0.6beta9:
===========================
Network status queue data reception is much better and should work
without problem now.  Previously Gfax would crash or the entire queue
would not be displayed if there were many jobs.

Gfax will now display the number of jobs left in the Send queue in 
the window title bar so one can track send status when Gfax is 
minimized. 

The total number of jobs displayed in the status line at the bottom
of the window.  This status line will also show when Gfax is 
auto-refreshing the queue.

Queue selection has been added to the "Job" menu.

When sending a fax from the "New Fax" button, fax destinations can be 
deselected.  You can now select an entire phone book and then deselect
a few numbers.

Bug fixes:
----------
	*start auto refresh on program startup if enabled.
	*change socket read code so all data will be read in hylafax.cs
	*when deleting jobs from the Done queue it is refreshed properly.
	



Whats new in gfax-0.6beta8:
===========================
Well it turns out that the beta7 didn't quite do the job.  The
Send Wizrad worked with a phone book item but not entering a 
number in the entry box, this is now fixed.  Also the fax wizard 
would send the fax to the server even if there weren't any valid 
destinations, this is also fixed.


Whats new in gfax-0.6beta7:
===========================
This is just a quick bug fix as beta6 send wizard was bad.


Whats new in gfax-0.6beta6:
===========================
Ported to mono >= 0.30 and gtk-sharp-0.15.
It should work on the likes of Fedora Core 1 and Redhat 9 to name a few.

If you run Fedora try our yum repository for installation, see
http://gfax.cowlug.org for more information.

The biggest news is a new wizard to add phone books.  The old way of
adding phone books was prone to error and not intuitive at all.


Bug fixes:
----------
	*remove glade errors when starting.
	*clear phone book list items at appropriate times.
	*deleting phone book correctly deletes the file.

Changes:
---------
	*compile with gtk-sharp-0.15 and Mono-0.30.
	*swap "Add" and "Clear" buttons for adding phone items.
	*added stock icons to "Add" and "Clear" buttons.
	*added class for new phone book wizard.
	*changes to main code to support new phone book wizard.
	*new dialog in gfax.glade file for new phone book
	 




Whats new in gfax-0.6beta5:
===========================
This version is basically a port to mono >= 0.28 and gtk-sharp-0.14.
It should work on the likes of Fedora Core 1 and Redhat 9 to name a few.

This is the first version with a proper working spec file for building 
rpms.

Fedora Core 1 users note:
Unless one has the CVS version of Orbit gfax will crash upon exit, this 
is not a problem, everything still works fine.  Fedora Core 2 will most 
likely have this fixed.

Bug fixes:
----------
	*created spec file for rpms.
	*fixed schema installation, works for all users now.
	*adding new phone book didn't work quite right, fixed.
	*deleteing item in phonebook didn't allow saving after, fixed.
	*now compiles with mono >= 0.28 and gtk-sharp-0.14.
	 
Changes:
----------
	*none.

Whats new in gfax-0.6beta4:
===========================
The send druid now displays all the numbers that you have choosen to send 
the fax to.  Each number in the list is preceded with a check mark which 
allows you to deselect numbers in your list.  For example:
	-Print to a fax to send it.
	-Press the "Phonebook" button and select a phonebook from the "Phone Books"
	 list and press "OK".
	-You should now see all the numbers that were in your phone book.
	-Deselect desired numbers by toggling the checkmark off.

Numbers may be "built up" by continually selecting phone books, phone book
items or manually entering a number in the entry provided.

Stretching the druid expands the list properly.

Other changes to the send druid include the ability to change the facsimile
resolution, email address and notification feature.  Notification and
resolution settings previously didn't get transmitted to hylafax, they are 
now working.

Bug fixes:
----------
	*Don't delete your file when sending the file from the "New Fax" fucntion.
	*Don't delete your file if piped in from the command line.
	*Delete Job button was active when no jobs to delete.
	*Delete item button active when no items selected.	
	*Removed modal setting from About dialog.
	*When adding numbers from a phone book in the send druid it wouldn't 
	 display a single number if the organization was not set.
	 
Changes:
----------
	*Send druid now displays numbers to send instead of "MULTIPLE NUMBERS."
	*Added toggle to send druid, you can now deselect numbers.
	*Resolution setting is now functional for Hylafax.
	*Email notification is now functional for Hylafax.
	*Changed spool directory location to /var/spool/gfax
	*Set "Rules Hint" in glade file so lists follow theme.
	*Added phonebook support to "New Fax" function.
	*Clear "New Fax" page properly if switching to main and back.
	

Whats new in gfax-0.6beta3:
===========================
This release should be far more functional that previous releases, please join
the mail list and help with bug reports.  Many thanks to Stephan Sachse for
his feedback.

Bug fixes:
----------
  *create phonebook directory (~/.etc/gfax/) if it doesn't exist.
  *create "phonebooks" file if it doesn't exist.

Changes:
----------
  *Changed the default queue that is displayed on startup to the send queue.
  *Added ability to delete Hylafax jobs.
  *Made "Delete Job" button sensitive only when showing send queue.

  *Gfax now attempts to display the proper sensitivity for many
   buttons, such as "Delete" and "Edit" in the Phonebooks page.

  *The send fax page is now functional and postscript files can be sent
   directly from gfax.

  *The makefile has been updated to install schema on "make install", you
   will no longer have to do a seperate "make schema".

  *When creating a new phone book the base directory defaults to ~/.etc/gfax
   so users will only have to enter a file name and not the entire path.

  *Created a gfaxlpr command for use with apps like OpenOffice.  It seem that
   reading input in the shell sometimes fails so gfaxlpr does nothing but
   read from the standard input.  Hopefully this will work better for 
   printing from applications.  See the INSTALL file for more information
   about defining printers in OpenOffice.
